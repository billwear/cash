## MAAS CLI Tools

Just a little set of scripts that reproduce text versions of UI screens (like the Machine List, for example) on your terminal.   Also useful for CLI-centric documentation.

* *machine-list* prints a text machine list, very much like the MAAS UI machine list.

As usual -- YMMV, y'all.
