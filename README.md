## MAAS CLI Tools

Just a little set of scripts that reproduce text versions of UI screens (like the Machine List, for example) on your terminal:   

* **machine-list** prints a text machine list, very much like the MAAS UI machine list.  It requires pip-ing the **tabulate** module.  Here's an example:

![machine list](text-machine-list.jpg)

Also useful for CLI-centric documentation.

As usual -- YMMV, y'all.
